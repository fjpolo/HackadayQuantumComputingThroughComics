    "# Quantum error correction - bit-flip code quantum kata\n",
    "\n",
    "The **\"Quantum error correction - bit-flip code\"** quantum kata is a series of exercises designed to get you familiar with quantum error correction (QEC) and programming in Q#.  It introduces you to the simplest of QEC codes - the three-qubit bit-flip code, which encodes each logical qubit in three physical qubits and protects against single bit-flip error (equivalent to applying an X gate).  In practice quantum systems can have other types of errors, which will be considered in the following katas on quantum error correction.  \n",
