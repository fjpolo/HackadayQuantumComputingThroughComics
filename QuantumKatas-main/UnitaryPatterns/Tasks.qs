    // The "Unitary Patterns" quantum kata is a series of exercises designed
    // to get you comfortable with creating unitary transformations which can be represented
    // with matrices of certain shapes (with certain pattern of zero and non-zero values).
    
    // Each task is wrapped in one operation preceded by the description of the task.
    // Each task has a unit test associated with it, which initially fails.
    // Your goal is to fill in the blank (marked with // ... comment)
    // with some Q# code to make the failing test pass.
    
    // The tasks are given in approximate order of increasing difficulty;
    // harder ones are marked with asterisks.
    
    // Each task describes a matrix which your unitary needs to implement.
    // The row and column indices of the matrix elements are in little-endian format (the least significant bit is stored first).
    // For example, index 1 corresponds to the qubit state |10..0⟩, and to store this state in an array of qubits qs 
    // its first element qs[0] would have to be in state |1⟩ and the rest of the qubits would have to be in state |0⟩.

    // In the example patterns provided in the tasks, X marks a "non-zero" element, and . marks a "zero" element.
    // "Zero" element of a matrix is a complex number which has an absolute value of 0.001 or less,
    // and "non-zero" element is a complex number which has an absolute value of 0.001 or greater.
    // You can see the details of the verification in Tests.qs file, operation AssertOperationMatrixMatchesPattern.

    // Note that all tasks require you to implement a unitary transformation,
    // which means that you're not allowed to use any measurements.

    // Input: N qubits in an arbitrary state.
